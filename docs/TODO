lib2d planned features:

8-bit surfaces on the scrolling buffers makes a very fast renderer

allow multiple concurrent gamestates
integrate dialogs from mh and allow customization(?)
the sheetloader should be updated to only support the grid format
the grid utilities should be updated

game objects need a new system that has special handling of pickles:
    pygame objects cannot be pickled, but the actors can
    pygame objects need a way to load resources off disk from a pickle


why pickles?
    cause it would not make sense to keep all objects in memory.
    makes a system of persistence that is built in python


When loading only the tree should be available at first.

zombie survival simulation
random game each time
hard rules…sandbox?
score given.  play time should be about an hour?
fallout style missions:
	random encounters
	immersive, rather than focused on action
use of goap ai to simulate npcs
how about…turn based, rougelike?
features from movies/tv that should be in game:
	barricading using objects in room (push chair to wall?)
	stockpiling items
	morale bonus for hot shower
	head shots?
	health items: anti-biotics, pain pills, steroids, etc
	ability to use objects as weapons
	safe houses
	rumors
	party forming


mega maps:
divide large maps into regions
regions can be loaded from disk, complete with geometry
entities in the game world can request regions be loaded into memory
renderer should be able to render many regions simutaneously
the tilesets 'images' can be loaded on the fly without affecting metadata
