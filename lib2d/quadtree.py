"""
Module contains two classes for quadtree collision detection.

In Lib2d, they are used in various parts in rendering and collision detection
between 'sprites' and world geometry.

It is important to remember that once the quadtree's are useful for static
objects (which is why it is being used for world geometry).  There are
probably better solutions for moving objects.
