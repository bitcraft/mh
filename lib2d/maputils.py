    using parts that are cobbled together."

    turn a list of points into a rects 
    adjacent rects will be combined.

    plain english:
        the input list must be a a list of tuples that represent
        the areas to be combined into rects
        the rects will be blended together over solid groups

        so if data is something like:

        0 1 1 1 0 0 0 
        0 1 1 0 0 0 0 
        0 0 0 0 0 4 0 
        0 0 0 0 0 4 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
        0 0 1 1 1 1 1

        you'll have the 4 rects that mask the area like this:

        ..######......
        ..####........
        ..........##..
        ..........##..
        ..............
        ....##########

        pretty cool, right?

    there are cases where the number of rectangles is not as low as possible,
    but i haven't found that it is excessively bad.  certainly much better than
    making a list of rects, one for each tile on the map!
